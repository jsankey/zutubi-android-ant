Zutubi Android Ant Tasks
========================

Introduction
------------

The zutubi-android-ant project provides a collection of Ant tasks that
are useful for Android (http://www.android.com/) projects.  These
tasks are intended to complement the Ant support provided by the
Android SDK.

Available Tasks
---------------

Currently, zutubi-android-ant contains four tasks:

* lint

A task that makes it simpler to run the Android lint tool.  This task
is an extension of the built-in exec task that will find lint based on
the value of sdk.dir and your current operating system.

* ndkbuild

A task that makes it simpler to run the native build command ndk-build.
This task is an extension of the built-in exec task that will find
ndk-build based on the value of ndk.dir and your current operating
system.

* setversion

A task that can update the versionName and/or versionCode attributes
of an android manifest XML file, leaving the rest of the file
unchanged.

Attributes (all optional):
code: the versionCode to set (default: leave unchanged)
name: the versionName to set (default: leave unchanged)
manifestfile: path of the manifest file (default: AndroidManifest.xml)

* bumpversion

A task to increment the versionCode attribute of a manifest file, and
optionally the versionName attribute (if it uses a dotted-decimal
format).

Attributes (all optional):
bumpname: if true, the last element of the version name will also be
          incremented (default: false)
manifestfile: path of the manifest file (default: AndroidManifest.xml)

Obtaining the Jar
-----------------

You can download the latest zutubi-android-ant release from the GitHub
downloads page:

http://github.com/jsankey/zutubi-android-ant/downloads

You can also grab the latest directly from the build server:

http://pulse.zutubi.com/browse/projects/zutubi-android-ant-release/builds/success/

(Click on "jar" in the "featured artifacts" table on the right of the
page.)

Using the Tasks
---------------

To use zutubi-android-ant in your projects, you should add the jar
file to your source tree, then use the taskdef Ant task to import the
tasks.  The recommended way to do this is to define an XML namespace
for the tasks, and reference the antlib.xml file provided in the jar.
For example, you can define a namespace on the root element of your
build file as follows:

<project name="MyProject" xmlns:zaa="antlib:com.zutubi.android.ant">

Then within this root element, add the following taskdef:

<taskdef uri="antlib:com.zutubi.android.ant"
	 resource="com/zutubi/android/ant/antlib.xml"
	 classpath="path/to/zutubi-android-ant.jar"/>

With this namespace and taskdef in place, you are able to access the
tasks using the "zaa:" namespace prefix.  For example, to use the
setversion task in a versioned-release target:

<target name="versioned-release">
    <zaa:setversion code="3" name="0.3"/>
    ...
</target>

See the examples/ subdirectory for simple Ant build files that
illustrate the usage of each task (you will need to build the jar
first to run them, see below).

Building
--------

To build the task jar, use ant in the root directory of this source
tree:

$ ant jar

More ant targets are available, for details run:

$ ant -p

The build uses the Ant Script Library (http://www.exubero.com/asl/)
for those that wish to understand further.
